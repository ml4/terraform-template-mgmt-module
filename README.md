# terraform-template-mgmt-module
Template landing zone repository for use with eliza.
This repository is only used to version code used to create and configure arbitrary numbers of TFE or TFC workspaces for your application teams.

This code requires for there to be TFE/C child modules for both workspaces and workspace variables so that the application workspaces can be deployed correctly.
